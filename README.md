# Running the project
Running the project is much easier using google colab since you don't have to install anything and you can learn more about google colab and how to use it in this link
[Using Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

If you want to run it locally on your machine, I highly recommend using Anaconda to much the installation process much easier.
